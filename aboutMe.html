            <h2>About me:</h2>

            <p>
            <h3>When I first started using a Computer:</h3>
            Well, since the first day I remember, I already used a computer. When asking my father and mother, they
            say
            that I started using a Computer when I was 3 years old. I played puzzle and math games. In Grade 4 I learned that
            my primary school give programming lessons after school. Sadly we could not affort it. In Grade 5 I got
            a game idea that I wanted to program, but I did not know how to code. I guess it was eather in grade 4 or 5 when
            a switch was triggered that made me want to learn coding.
            <br><br>
            <h3>My subject choises:</h3>
            At the end of grade 9 all the grade 9's got a letter that was filled with small tick boxes in which you
            must mark
            what subject you want to take in grade 10. I went with math, eng FAL, afrikaans home, physical science,
            accounting
            and last, but not least, IT(computer science).
            <br><br>
            <h3>Grade 10 and 11:</h3>
            From grade 10 I knew I was going to do good in IT. I enjoyed going home and making
            programs
            for the fun of it. I also made a few games. On test day I showed up with methods and algorithms I figured
            out
            on my own that works for solving commen problems found in grade 10 and 11 tests. All was going very good
            untill
            the first test I could not get done in time. I was slow at typing.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Grade 12:</h3>
            I dont know why, but the firts time I started to learn IT by doing past papers was for the grade 12 end exam
            and damn. That made a big difference. The test was as easy as can come. Sadly the start of the year was
            horrible. At the end I got 75% for IT.
            <br><br>
            <h3>My struggles and solutions:</h3>
            I have my fair share of problems. I can't go to university. I don't have a turor. I am not sure that I am
            learning the right stuff, because everyone have their own fullstack roadmap.All this makes me stress, but...
            <br>
            I have a solution. Just try over and over again to become a web-developer. One day it will work. It may
            sound
            stupid, but atleast it is something. I will close my eyes, and just do it.
            <br><br>
            <h3>My vision:</h3>
            I believe that everyone that wants to reach success must have a plan to be successful. <br><br>
            Now this is my plan: <br>
            1. Learn web development. <br>
            2. Add a comment section to my website (I thought that I would be able to do it with JSON files, but when I leaned JS with JSON files,
            i saw that it will not be possible, that is as far as I know) <br>
            3. Advertise my skills (freelancing) <br>
            4. Register a IT business <br>
            5. Expand my business by doing pc builds <br>
            6. Work hard. <br> <br>
            <h3>Thanks:</h3>
            I just want to thank you for reading my story. If you have any advice or encouragement to give me,
            please leave a comment on my Github.
