            <h2>About me:</h2>

            <p>
            <h3>When I first started using a Computer:</h3>
            Well, since the first day I remember, I already used a computer. When asking my father and mother, they
            say
            that I started using a Computer when I was 2 years old. I played puzzle and math games. I remember that
            I
            played almost the entire day when I was six, that is when I was not at school. In Grade 4 I learned that
            my primary school give programming lessons after school. Sadly we could not affort it. In Grade 5 I got
            a game idea that I wanted to program, but I did not know how. I guess it was eather in grade 4 or 5 when
            a switch was triggered that made me want to learn coding. In grade 7 I stoped playing games that can
            keep me busy for more that a hour a day.
            <br><br>
            <h3>My subject choises:</h3>
            At the end of grade 9 all the grade 9's got a letter that was filled with small tick boxes in which you
            must mark
            what subject you want to take in grade 10. I went with math, eng FAL, afrikaans home, physical science,
            accounting
            and last, but not least IT(computer science).
            <br><br>
            <h3>Grade 10 and 11:</h3>
            From grade 10 I knew I was going to do good in IT. I would listen for a couple of seconds what the teacher
            sait, then I would ignore the rest and figure it all by my self out. I enjoyed going home and making
            programs
            for the fun of it. I also made a few games. On test day I showed up with methods and algorithms I figured
            out
            on my own that works for solving commen problems found in grade 10 and 11 tests. All was going very good
            untill
            the first test I could not get done in time. I am a slow typing.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Grade 12:</h3>
            I dont know why, but the firts time I started to learn IT by doing past papers was for the grade 12 end exam
            and damn. That made a big difference. The test was as easy as can come. Sadly the start of the year was
            horrible.
            <br><br>
            <h3>My struggles and solutions:</h3>
            I have my fair share of problems. I can't go to university. I don't have a turor. I am not sure that I am
            learning the right stuff, because everyone have their own fullstack roadmap. I don't have money to be able
            to get certificates online. All this makes me stress, but...
            <br>
            I have a solution. Just try over and over again to become a web-developer. One day it will work. It may
            sound
            stupid, but atleast it is something. I will close my eyes, pray and try.
            <br><br>
            <h3>My vision:</h3>
            I believe that everyone that wants ro reach success must have a plan to be successful. <br><br>
            Now this is my plan: <br>
            1. Learn web development. <br>
            2. Get a web development job. <br>
            3. Work hard. <br> <br>
            <h3>Thanks:</h3>
            I just want to thank you for reading my story. If you have any advice or encouragement to give me,
            please leave a comment on my Github.
