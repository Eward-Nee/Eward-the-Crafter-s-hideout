            <h3>Why a total redo?:</h3>

            <p>
                Well, I love to redo projects I made that is not perfect.
                It helps me to improve my skills if I do a project over and over again.
                I Just dont believe in dead projects. I also don't believe in a perfect program.
                There will always be something wrong, thus will there always be something to improve.
                <br><br>
                I believe that a programmer is as mush worth as his website, so I will always
                do my best to try and make my website as good as possible. You can expect many redos
                of my website, because im am still learning web-development. I will be adding new
                features as I learn them
                <br><br>
                I guess what I am trying to say is that you must please stay tuned as I learn
                new skills and put them to practise on my website.

            <h3>Short overview:</h3>

            <p>
                Hi, I am Eward van Niekerk. <br>
                I am the sole developer of this website. I am 19 years old and recently started learning
                web-development. This Website is made because I love coding and I want to share that love
                and passion with you, the viewer of this website.
                <br>
                <hr><br>
                You see the navigation bar? <br>
                Do you notice the tabs? <br>
                I am going to explain what you can expect on each tab:
                <br><br>
                <b>The Home tab:</b> <br>
                This is the home tab. When the home tab is clicked when you are on the home page already,
                it will cause the opening animation to play. If you are not on the home page and you clickedon the home
                tab,
                will take you to the home page without playing the opening animation.
                <br><br>
                <b>The Projects tab:</b><br>
                This tab will contain links to my #day-of-training repos on my github account so that you can check them
                out if
                you want to. It will also contain links to some of my projects that I am hosting via github pages.
                <br><br>
                <b>The Learning tab:</b><br>
                This tab will contain what I have already learned, what I am currently learning and what what I will be
                learning
                in the future (that is what I am sure about).I will be adding new stuff to the future list when I am
                sure about something
                else I want to learn in the future. I am considering to add Rust and or Go to the list, but I am not yet
                sure.
                I am also thinking of learning c++, c# and Assembly, but I dont yet know if I will and if so, when I
                will.
                <br><br>
                <b>The About me tab</b>
                This tab will contain exstra information about me. It will contain info such as my birth country, when I
                first started
                to use a computer, when I first got a interest in coding, why I could not learn to code at that age, my
                coding journy
                that started in grade 10 and what I have learned from grade 10, 11 and 12. I will also share my
                struggles in the pursuit
                of becoming a web-developer. Last, but not least will I share my goals with you.
                <br><br>
                And that is that at the moment. I hope you have a good time viewing my website and thanks for giving up
                some of your
                time by viewing my website.
